=============

Errordite is a simple plug-in for any .net application that will log details of exceptions generated by your application. Errordite will group together errors that are the same, either automatically or with rules you define. You then decide how to progress with the errors. You can investigate them, request to ignore them or put them on hold while you have more pressing concerns.

This CodePlex project contains the client libraries for Errordite.
